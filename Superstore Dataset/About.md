# Tableau Sales Analysis (Sample Superstore Dataset)

This project explores sales and profit trends using the Tableau Sample - Superstore dataset. The goal was to apply various Tableau visualization techniques to uncover insights across different dimensions such as region, state, category, and time.

## Key Visualizations
* Sales by State/Province – Bar chart comparing sales performance across states.
* Geographic Distribution of Sales – Filled maps showing sales intensity across the US and Canada.
* Sales by City – Scatter/point map highlighting sales at the city level.
* Monthly Sales Trend – Area chart capturing seasonality and monthly fluctuations in sales.
* Sales by Product Sub-Category – Bubble chart to compare sub-category contributions.
* Sales vs Profit by Sub-Category – Dual-axis chart analyzing sales and profit margins together.

## Insights
* Sales are highly concentrated in certain states (e.g., California, New York, and Texas).
* Seasonal trends indicate strong peaks during end-of-year months.
* Some sub-categories (like Tables) generate high sales but low or negative profit, highlighting inefficiencies.
* Technology-related products (e.g., Copiers) show high profitability compared to other categories.
* Regional differences suggest that product performance is not uniform across the US.
