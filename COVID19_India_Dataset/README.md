# COVID-19 India Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing the spread and impact of COVID-19 across India using publicly available datasets. The goal is to uncover trends in confirmed cases, recoveries, deaths, and testing over time, as well as state-wise variations.

## Key Analyses
* State-wise Cases – Comparison of confirmed, active, recovered, and deceased cases across different states and union territories.
* Trend Over Time – Visualization of how cases evolved month by month, capturing the rise and fall of pandemic waves.
* Recovery & Mortality Rates – Analysis of health outcomes to understand the effectiveness of responses in different states.
* Testing Data – Relation between testing levels and case detection.
* Geographic Spread – Heatmaps/choropleths showing the intensity of COVID-19 cases across India.

## Insights

* Clear evidence of multiple pandemic waves with steep rises in confirmed cases followed by recovery surges.
* Some states consistently reported higher case loads (e.g., Maharashtra, Kerala, Delhi) while others were less affected.
* Recovery rates improved over time, but mortality rates varied across states due to healthcare capacity differences.
* Testing levels were correlated with higher detection, highlighting the role of widespread testing in case identification.
